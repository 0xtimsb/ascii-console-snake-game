# C++ Retro_Snake_Console_Based_Game
Made this project in my freshman year, all on my own. Learned a lot about C++ and logical thinking.

Spent 2-3 hrs making snake game with C++, without any game engine and without any tutorials. Fully on my own. This is my first console based game. ðŸ¤ª
$ Got to know more about what C++ can do. And it's amazing libraries.
$ Used stack overflow to learn cursor and it's functionalities in windows console.
$ Instead of clearing console screen constantly and updating it. (It causes flickering issues). I used cursor x-y position to make it running and make everything run smoothly.
$ Food gets spawned by rand() function on to gird with random x-y indexes.

Thinking about making more such projects and making them open-source.

Love to share my everyday progress.
Thank you. ðŸ˜‹
